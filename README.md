2. Descriptive Analysis:
- Generate summary statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation) for numerical variables.
- Create frequency distributions for categorical variables.
3. Data Visualization:
- Create visualizations (histograms, bar charts, box plots) to display the distribution of key variables such as Age, Income, BMI, and Mental Health Status.
- Develop a dashboard to provide a comprehensive overview of the health status in Wayne County.
4. Correlation Analysis:
